\title{Plot the SOM grid with neurons labeled}
\usage{
sits_plot_kohonen(koh, type = "codes", whatmap = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{koh}{Data to be plotted (must be a kohonen object).}

\item{type}{Type of plot. "codes" is the weight of neuron (time series) and "mapping" is the number of samples allocated in a neuron.}

\item{whatmap}{What data layer will be plotted.}
}
\description{
Given a kohonen object with a set of time neurons, plot them.

The plot function produces different plots based on the input data:
\itemize{
 \item{"codes": }{Plot in each neuron the vector weight which corresponds to it.}
 \item{"mapping": }{Shows where samples are mapped.}
}
Function sits_plot_kohonen plots a classified kohonen map. A set of neurons
with same category corresponds to a same cluster.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
#' # Read a set of samples
data(samples_mt_6bands)
# perform kohonen to associate a sample to  a cluster
koh <- sits_kohonen(samples_mt_6bands, bands = NULL, grid_xdim = 15, grid_ydim = 15)
# Visualize the samples with cluster information
sits_plot_kohonen(koh)
# Plot kohonen map with vector of weight
sits_plot_kohonen(koh, type = "codes")
# Plot kohonen map showing where the samples were allocated
sits_plot_kohonen(koh, type = "mapping")
