\title{Area-weighted classification accuracy assessment}
\usage{
sits_accuracy(validation, area)
}
\arguments{
\item{validation}{A SITS tibble or CSV file with validation data}

\item{area}{A named vector of the total area of each class on
the map}
}
\description{
To use this function the input table should be
a set of results containing
both the label assigned by the user and the classification result.
Accuracy assessment set us a confusion matrix to determine the accuracy
of your classified result.
This function uses an area-weighted technique proposed by Olofsson et al. to
produce more reliable accuracy estimates at 95% confidence level.

This function performs an accuracy assessment of the classified, including
Overall Accuracy, User's Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy
and error matrix (confusion matrix) according to [1-2].
