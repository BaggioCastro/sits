\description{
Retrieve a set of time series and puts it in a "sits tibble".
Sits tibbles are the main structures of sits package.
They contain both the satellite image time series and its metadata.
A sits tibble is a tibble with pre-defined columns that
has the metadata and data for each time series. The columns are
<longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, cube, time_series>.
There are two main ways of retrieving time series:
1. Using a time series service and from a data cube defined based on a set of Raster Bricks. Two time series services are available:
(a) the Web Time Series Service (WTSS) by INPE; (b) the SATVEG service from EMBRAPA.
Please see \code{\link[sits]{sits_services}} for more information on thw WTSS service.
The URL and other parameters for access to the time series services are defined in the package
configuration file. This file is called "config.yml". Please see the \code{\link[sits]{sits_config}} for
more information.

Before using this service, the user should create a valid description of a data cube Â´
using the \code{\link[sits]{sits_cube}} function.

The following options are available:
\enumerate{
\item No input file is given - it retrieves the data and metadata based on the latitude/longitude location
and on the information provided by the WTSS server.
\item The source is a CSV file - retrieves the metadata from the CSV file and the time series
from the WTSS service.
\item The source is a SHP file - retrives all points inside the shapefile from the WTSS service.
\item The source is a RasterBrick - retrieves the point based on lat/long from the RasterBrick.
}
 The results is a sits tibble, which  has the metadata and data for each time series
<longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, cube, time_series>
