SITS - Satellite Image Time Series Analysis for Data Cubes
================

The SITS package is a set of tools for working with satellite image time
series. Includes data retrieval from a WTSS (web time series service),
different visualisation methods for image time series, smoothing methods
for noisy time series, different clustering methods, including
dendrograms and SOM. Matches noiseless patterns with noisy time series
using the TWDTW method for shape recognition and provides machine
learning methods for time series classification, including SVM, LDA,
QDA, GLM, Lasso, Random Forests and Deep Learning.

### Overview

The **sits** package is a set of tools for working with satellite image
time series, that:

  - Supports for data retrieval from a web time series services, rasters
    files and other data sets.
  - Provides different visualisation methods for image time series.
  - Includes smoothing methods for noisy time series.
  - Enables different clustering methods, including dendrograms and SOM
    (Kohonen maps).
  - Matches noiseless patterns with noisy time series using the TWDTW
    method for shape recognition.
  - Provides machine learning methods for time series classification,
    including SVM, LDA, QDA, GLM, Lasso, Random Forests and Deep
    Learning.

**sits** is a convenient front-end to many analysis package that are
useful for satellite image time series analysis. The package organizes
time series data using tibbles, which makes it quite simple for users to
manage time series data sets.

### Interface to CRAN data analysis packages

**sits** is a convenient front-end to many packages that are useful for
satellite image time series analysis. Given data sets organized as time
series tibbles, the package provides easy access to many packages for
time series analysis:

  - **keras** for Deep Learning classification.
  - **e1071** for SVM models.
  - **MASS** for LDA and QDA models.
  - **nnet** for multinomial log-linear models.
  - **glmnet** for generalized linear models.
  - **ranger** for random forest methods.
  - **dtwclust** for time series clustering.
  - **kohonen** for clustering based on SOM.
  - **dtwSat** for access to the time-weigthed dynamic time warping
    algorithm.
  - **signal** for filtering.

**sits** also relies extensively on the **tidyverse**, **data.table**,
**raster** and **sf** packages. The tight integration achieved by tha
package makes it easier for users to perform different types of analysis
on satellite image time series.

### Installation

Please install the SITS package from github, making sure you have the
latest version of the other packages it requires:

``` r
devtools::install_github("e-sensing/sits")
```

### Basic data structure

After loading the library, users can print a **sits** tibble to see how
the package organizes the data.

``` r
samples_mt_6bands[1:3,]
#> # A tibble: 3 x 7
#>   longitude latitude start_date end_date   label   cube    time_series     
#>       <dbl>    <dbl> <date>     <date>     <chr>   <chr>   <list>          
#> 1     -58.6    -13.9 2007-09-14 2008-08-28 Cerrado MOD13Q1 <tibble [23 × 7…
#> 2     -59.7    -13.6 2006-09-14 2007-08-29 Cerrado MOD13Q1 <tibble [23 × 7…
#> 3     -52.6    -15.0 2008-09-13 2009-08-29 Cerrado MOD13Q1 <tibble [23 × 7…
```

The **sits** tibble contains data and metadata. The first six columns
contain the metadata: spatial and temporal location, label assigned to
the sample, and coverage from where the data has been extracted. The
spatial location is given in longitude and latitude coordinates for the
“WGS84” ellipsoid. For example, the first sample has been labelled
“Pasture”, at location (-55.1852, -10.8387), and is considered valid
for the period (2013-09-14, 2014-08-29).

To display the time series, we provide `sits_plot()` function to display
the time series. Given a small number of samples to display, the
`sits_plot()` function tries to group as many spatial locations
together. In the following example, the first 15 samples of the
“Cerrado” class all refer to the same spatial location in
consecutive time periods. For this reason, these samples are plotted
together.

``` r
# select the "ndvi" band
samples_ndvi.tb <- sits_select_bands(samples_mt_6bands, ndvi)
# select only the samples with the cerrado label
samples_cerrado.tb <- dplyr::filter(samples_ndvi.tb, 
                  label == "Cerrado")
```

For a large number of samples, where the amount of individual plots
would be substantial, the default visualisation combines all samples
together in a single temporal interval. This plot is useful to show the
spread of values for the time series of each band. The strong red line
in the plot shows the median of the values, and the two orange lines are
the first and third interquartile ranges.

``` r
# plot all cerrado samples together (shows the distribution)
sits_plot(samples_cerrado.tb)
```

### Importing Data into `sits`

**sits** allows different methods of data input, including: (a) obtain
data from a time series web services such as INPE’s WTSS (Web Series
Time Service) or EMBRAPA’s SATVEG; (b) read data stored in a time series
in the ZOO format \[@Zeileis2005\]; (c) read a time series from a TIFF
RasterBrick. More services will be added in future releases.

### Clustering

Clustering is a way to improve training data to use in machine learning
classification models. In this regard, cluster analysis can assist the
identification of structural patterns and anomalous samples. **sits**
provides support for the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC)
using the DTW (dynamic time warping) distance measure. After creating a
dendrogram, we compute a validity index and returns the clustering that
meets the best value.

``` r
# take a set of patterns for 2 classes
# create a dendrogram object with default clustering parameters
clusters.tb <- sits_cluster(cerrado_2classes)
#> calculating dendrogram...
#> finding the best cut for the dendrogram...
#> best number of clusters = 6
#> best height for cutting the dendrogram = 20.3965461960775
#> cutting the tree...
#> Plotting dendrogram...
#> result is a tibble with cluster indexes...
```

<img src="man/figures/README-dendrogram-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We can then see the cluster frequency using `sits_cluster_frequency`. In
the example, we note that cluster \(3\), unlike other clusters, includes
a mix of two classes. Users can then remove this cluster with
`sits_cluster_remove`to reduce the number of mixed-class samples.

``` r
# show clusters samples frequency
sits_cluster_frequency(clusters.tb)
#>          
#>             1   2   3   4   5   6 Total
#>   Cerrado 203  13  23  80   1  80   400
#>   Pasture   2 176  28   0 140   0   346
#>   Total   205 189  51  80 141  80   746
# clear those samples with a high confusion rate in a cluster 
clean.tb <- sits_cluster_clean(clusters.tb)
# show clean clusters samples frequency
sits_cluster_frequency(clean.tb)
#>          
#>             1   2   3   4   5   6 Total
#>   Cerrado 203   0   0  80   0  80   363
#>   Pasture   0 176  28   0 140   0   344
#>   Total   203 176  28  80 140  80   707
```

### Filtering

Satellite image time series are contaminated by atmospheric influence
and directional effects. To make the best use of available satellite
data archives, methods for satellite image time series analysis need to
deal with data sets that are *noisy* and *non-homogeneous*. For data
filtering, `sits` supports Savitzky–Golay (`sits_sgolay()`), Whittaker
(`sits_whittaker()`), envelope (`sits_envelope()`) and the “cloud
filter” (`sits_cloud_filter()`). As an example, we show how to apply
the Whitakker smoother to the data.

``` r
# Take the NDVI band of the first sample data set
point.tb <- sits_select_bands(prodes_226_064[1,], ndvi)
# apply Whitaker filter
point_whit.tb <- sits_whittaker(point.tb)
# plot the series
sits_plot(sits_merge(point_whit.tb, 
                     point.tb))
```

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning

**sits** explores the full depth of satellite image time series data for
classification. It treat time series as a feature vector, formed by all
pixel “bands”. The idea is to have as many temporal attributes as
possible, increasing the dimension of the classification space. In this
scenario, statistical learning models are the natural candidates to deal
with high-dimensional data: learning to distinguish all land cover and
land use classes from trusted samples exemplars, also known as training
data, to infer classes of a larger data set.

We support a number of machine learning techniques, including SVM
(support vector machines), Random Forests, generalised linear models,
and gradient boosting machines, and deep learning. We show an example of
using the SVM and Deep Learning classifiers below.

``` r
# Build a machine learning model with a set of samples 
# for the Mato Grosso region (provided by EMBRAPA) (samples_mt_ndvi)
svm_model <- sits_train(samples_mt_ndvi, ml_method = sits_svm(kernel = "radial",  cost = 10))
# get a point to be classified (point_ndvi)

class.tb <- sits_classify(point_ndvi, svm_model)
sits_plot(class.tb)
```
