### Overview

The `sits` R package provides a set of tools for analysis, visualization
and classification of satellite image time series. The main aim of SITS
is to support land cover and land change classification of image data cubes 
using machine learning methods. The basic workflow in SITS is:

1. Create a data cube using image collections available in the cloud or in local 
machines.
2. Extract time series from the data cube which are used as training data.
3. Perform quality control and filtering on the samples. 
4. Train a machine learning model using the extracted samples.
5. Classify the data cube using the trained model.
6. Post-process the classified images. 

## Installation

### Pre-Requisites

The `sits` package relies on `sf`, `terra` and `raster`, which in turn, require
the installation of the GDAL and PROJ libraries. Please follow the instructions
for installing `sf` together with GDAL available at the [RSpatial sf github
repository](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).

### Obtaining SITS

SITS is currently available on github, as follows: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Please install the `sits` package from github
# and its dependencies
devtools::install_github("e-sensing/sits", dependencies = TRUE)
library(sits)
```

### AMI Image

For users that have an AWS account, we have prepared a set of AMI
(Amazon Machine Images that are optimized for running SITS in the Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (or EC2). The AMI has the following settings: SITS
0.9.6, Ubuntu 18.04, R 4.0.2, and Rstudio Server 1.3.959. All packages
have been updated as of 21 August 2020. The AMI is available for the
following regions:

-   [South America
    (sa-east-1)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=sa-east-1#launchAmi=ami-0567d9e8bca925a8d)
-   [Frankfurt(eu-central-1)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-central-1#launchAmi=ami-088e0eb8b0c3a74e3)
-   [US East
    (us-east-1)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#launchAmi=ami-02aa6bc45d45f75b9)
-   [Asia Pacific
    Singapore(ap-southeast-1)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-southeast-1#launchAmi=ami-025e0b3b65bedb145)

When you create an EC2 instance based on this AMI, ensure that your
‘security group’ settings allow incoming HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port
443) and SSH (port 20) traffic. After the EC2 instance is started, then
copy-and-paste the ‘IPv4 Public IP’ address for your running instance to
a web browser address bar. That should bring the RStudio server
interface in your browser. Use “rstudio” as username and “e-sensing” as
password.

### Data Cubes

SITS has been designed to work with big satellite image data sets organised as data cubes. Data cubes can be available in the cloud or in a local machine. Currently, SITS supports data cubes available in the following cloud services:

1. Sentinel-2/2A level 2A images in AWS.
2. Collections of Sentinel, Landsat and CBERS images in the Brazil Data Cube (BDC).
3. Sentinel-2/2A collections available in Digital Earth Africa.
4. Data cubes produced by the "gdalcubes" package.
5. Local image collections organized as raster stacks.

SITS relies on STAC services provided by these cloud services. The user can define a data cube by selecting a collection in a cloud service and then defining
a space-time extent. For example, the following code will define a data cube of Sentinel-2/2A images using AWS. Users need to provide AWS credentials using environment variables.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
s2_cube <- sits_cube(source = "AWS",
                     name = "T20LKP_2018_2019",
                     collection = "sentinel-s2-l2a",
                     tiles = c("20LKP"),
                     start_date = as.Date("2018-07-18"),
                     end_date = as.Date("2018-07-23"),
                     s2_resolution = 20
)
```
In the above example, the user has selected the "Sentinel-2 Level 2" collection in 
the AWS cloud services. The geographical area of the data cube is defined by the tile "20LKP", and the temporal extent by a start and end date. Access to other cloud services works in similar ways.

Users can derive data cubes from ARD data which have pre-defined temporal 
resolutions. For example, a user may want to define the best Sentinel-2 pixel in a
one month period, as shown below. This can be done in SITS by the
`sits_regularize` which calls the "gdalcubes" package. 
For details in gdalcubes, please see Reference [5] and  [https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
gc_cube <- sits_regularize(cube   = s2_cube,
                           name          = "T20LKP_2018_2019_1M",
                           dir_images    = tempdir(),
                           period        = "P1M",
                           agg_method    = "median",
                           resampling    = "bilinear",
                           cloud_mask    = TRUE)
```

### Accessing time series in data cubes

SITS has been designed to use satellite image time series to derive machine 
learning models. After the data cube has been created, time series can be retreived
individually or by using CSV or SHP files, as in the following example.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
library(sits)
# create a cube from a local file 
data_dir <- system.file("extdata/raster/mod13q1", package = "sits")
raster_cube <- sits_cube(
        source = "LOCAL",
        name = "sinop-2014",
        satellite = "TERRA",
        sensor = "MODIS",
        data_dir = data_dir,
        delim = "_",
        parse_info = c("X1", "X2", "band", "date")
)
# obtain a set of locations defined by a CSV file
csv_raster_file <- system.file("extdata/samples/samples_sinop_crop.csv",
                               package = "sits"
)
# retrieve the points from the data cube
points <- sits_get_data(raster_cube, file = csv_raster_file)
# show the points
points[1:3,]
```
After a time series is imported, it is loaded in a tibble. The first six columns contain the metadata: spatial and temporal location, label assigned to the sample, and coverage from where the data has been extracted. The spatial location is given in longitude and latitude coordinates. The first sample has been labelled “Pasture”, at location (-55.65931, -11.76267), and is considered valid for the period (2013-09-14, 2014-08-29). To display the time series, use the `plot()` function. 
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height=2.7, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Plot of point at location (-55.65931, -11.76267) labelled as Pasture"} 
plot(points[1,])
```

For a large number of samples, where the amount of individual plots would be substantial, the default visualisation combines all samples together in a single temporal interval.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# select the "ndvi" band
samples_ndvi <- sits_select(samples_modis_4bands, "NDVI")
# select only the samples with the cerrado label
samples_cerrado <- dplyr::filter(samples_ndvi, 
                  label == "Cerrado")
plot(samples_cerrado)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=2.7, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Samples for NDVI band for Cerrado class"}
knitr::include_graphics("./inst/extdata/markdown/figures/samples_cerrado.png")
```

### Clustering

Clustering methods in SITS improve the quality of the samples and to
remove those that might have been wrongly labeled or that have low
discriminatory power. Good samples lead to good classification maps.
`sits` provides support for two clustering methods to test sample
quality: (a) Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC); (b)
Self-organizing Maps (SOM). 

The process of clustering with SOM is done by `sits_som_map()`, which creates a self-organizing map and assesses the quality of the samples. This function uses the "kohonen" R package to compute a SOM grid (see Reference [7] below). Each sample is assigned to a neuron, and neurons are placed in the grid based on similarity. The second step is the quality assessment. Each neuron will be associated with a discrete probability distribution. Homogeneous neurons (those with a single class) are assumed to be composed of good quality samples. Heterogeneous neurons (those with two or more classes with significant probability) are likely to contain noisy samples. See [Chapter 4 of the sits book ](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/time-series-clustering-to-improve-the-quality-of-training-samples.html).

## Filtering

Satellite image time series are contaminated by atmospheric influence
and directional effects. To make the best use of available satellite
data archives, methods for satellite image time series analysis need to
deal with data sets that are *noisy* and *non-homogeneous*. For data
filtering, `sits` supports Savitzky–Golay (`sits_sgolay()`), Whittaker
(`sits_whittaker()`), envelope (`sits_envelope()`) and the “cloud
filter” (`sits_cloud_filter()`). As an example, we show how to apply the
Whitakker smoother to a 16-year NDVI time series. For more details,
please see the vignette [“Satellite Image Time Series Filtering with
SITS”](https://github.com/e-sensing/sits-docs/blob/master/doc/filters.pdf)


```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=2.7, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Whitaler filter of NDVI time series"}
# apply Whitaker filter to a time series sample for the NDVI band from 2000 to 2016
# merge with the original data
# plot the original and the modified series
point_ndvi <- sits_select(point_mt_6bands, bands = "NDVI")
point_whit <- sits_filter(point_ndvi, sits_whittaker(lambda = 10))
point_whit %>% 
  sits_merge(point_ndvi) %>% 
  plot()
```

## Time Series classification using machine learning 

SITS provides support for the classification of both individual time
series as well as data cubes. The following machine learning methods are
available in SITS:

-   Linear discriminant analysis (`sits_lda`)
-   Quadratic discriminant analysis (`sits_qda`)
-   Multinomial logit and its variants ‘lasso’ and ‘ridge’ (`sits_mlr`)
-   Support vector machines (`sits_svm`)
-   Random forests (`sits_rfor`)
-   Extreme gradient boosting (`sits_xgboost`)
-   Deep learning (DL) using multi-layer perceptrons
    (`sits_deeplearning`)
-   DL with 1D convolutional neural networks (`sits_FCN`)
-   DL combining 1D CNN and multi-layer perceptron networks
    (`sits_TempCNN`) (See reference [6])
-   DL using a combination of long-short term memory (LSTM) and 1D CNN
    (`sits_LSTM_FCN`) (See reference [5])

The following example illustrate how to train a dataset and classify an
individual time series. First we use the `sits_train` function with two
parameters: the training dataset (described above) and the chosen
machine learning model (in this case, extreme gradient boosting). 
The trained model is then used to classify a time series from Mato Grosso
Brazilian state, using `sits_classify`. The results can be shown in text
format using the function `sits_show_prediction` or graphically using
`plot`.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Time series classification using xgboost"}

data("point_mt_6bands")

# Train a machine learning model for the mato grosso dataset
samples_mt_2bands <- sits_select(samples_modis_4bands, bands = c("ndvi", "evi"))
xgb_model <- sits_train(data = samples_mt_2bands, 
                         ml_method = sits_xgboost(verbose = FALSE)) 

# get a point to be classified with four bands
point_mt_2bands <- sits_select(point_mt_6bands, bands = c("ndvi", "evi"))

# Classify using random forest model and plot the result
class.tb <- sits_classify(point_mt_2bands , xgb_model)

# plot the results of the prediction
plot(class.tb, bands = c("ndvi", "evi"))
```

The following example shows how to classify a data cube organised as a
set of raster image. First, we need to build a model based on the the
same bands as the data cube.

```{r}
# select the samples and bands for classification
# Retrieve the set of samples for the Mato Grosso region 
# Select the data for classification
samples_2bands  <- sits_select(samples_modis_4bands, 
                               bands = c("NDVI", "EVI"))

# build a machine learning model for this area
svm_model <- sits_train(samples_2bands, sits_svm())

# create a data cube to be classified
# Cube is composed of MOD13Q1 images from the Sinop region in Mato Grosso (Brazil)
data_dir <- system.file("extdata/raster/mod13q1", package = "sits")
sinop <- sits_cube(
    source = "LOCAL",
    name = "sinop-2014",
    satellite = "TERRA",
    sensor = "MODIS",
    data_dir = data_dir,
    delim = "_",
    parse_info = c("X1", "X2", "band", "date")
)
# Classify the raster cube, generating a probability file
probs_cube <- sits_classify(sinop, 
                            ml_model = svm_model, 
                            output_dir = tempdir(),
                            verbose = FALSE)
# apply a bayesian smoothing to remove outliers
bayes_cube <- sits_smooth(probs_cube)

# generate thematic map
label_cube <- sits_label_classification(bayes_cube)

# plot the first raster object with a selected color palette
# make a title, define the colors and the labels)
plot(label_cube)
```
